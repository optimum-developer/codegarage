          <b>Advantages of Deployment and Host Management Services</b>
        </h2>
        <ul className={`${hireService.hirelist}`}>
          <li>
            The ability to test the application before it goes live, which
            improves the overall quality of the product.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Reducing downtime. If an application is not properly tested, it can
            be prone to bugs and errors, which can cause problems for customers.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Improving customer satisfaction by providing a better user
            experience. For example, if a customer is having issues with your
            website, it is much better than ignoring them or simply telling them
            that everything is working fine.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>Easy to test and customize according to your requirements</li>
          <br />
          <li>Save time on manual tasks like configuration changes/updates</li>
